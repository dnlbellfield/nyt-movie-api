# NewYorkTimes Movie Reviews API- Search for movie reviews. 
The New York Times Developer Network
The NewYorkTimes APIs  (Application Programming Interfaces) allow you to programmatically access New York Times data for use in your own applications. Their goal is to facilitate a wide range of uses, from custom link lists to complex visualizations. Why just read the news when you can hack it?
NYT currently has ten public APIs: Archive, Article Search, Books, Community, Geographic, Most Popular, Semantic, Times Newswire, TimesTags, and Top Stories.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:

Using the NYT's Top Stories api.
1. What are the Times APIs?
Our APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow you to programmatically access New York Times data for use in your own applications. Our goal is to facilitate a wide range of uses, from custom link lists to complex visualizations. Why just read the news when you can hack it?

NYT currently has ten public APIs: Archive, Article Search, Books, Community, Geographic, Most Popular, Semantic, Times Newswire, TimesTags, and Top Stories.

2. Who is the intended audience for the Times APIs?
We've designed our APIs for the web developer community, but all non-commercial users are welcome. See our Terms of Use for more information.

3. Why are you offering APIs?
Like many organizations, we hope to encourage innovation through collaboration. When you build applications, create mashups and otherwise reveal the potential of our data, we learn more about what our readers want and gain insight into how news and information can be reimagined. We're hoping you'll show us what's next for The Times.

But we also have a simpler, more compelling reason: journalism. To inform the public or tell a story, we use articles, photos, videos, interactive graphics, slideshows and more. Data has always been the primary force behind those features, and now it can become a feature in its own right. Our APIs help us fulfill the newspaper's journalistic mission by putting more information in the hands of the public â€” and they also expand that mission by giving users the ability to find and tell their own stories.

4. What kinds of data can I access with Times APIs?
Please see our APIs page for the current list of available APIs.

5. How do I use the Times APIs?
Our APIs use a RESTful style and a resource-oriented architecture. Calls are made via HTTPS requests. Your request URIs should be patterned after the examples in the API documentation, and you should always include your API key in a query string. See the documentation for each API for more details on request parameters and URI structure.
